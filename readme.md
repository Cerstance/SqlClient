This is one of my experimental homework when I was a sophomore. It has been a long time that I didn't maintain it. Besides, It's the first project that I pushed on the Github! As an old saying goes, "Practice makes perfect". I think if I wanna be a senior programmer. I must practice more. I define this commit as version 1.0 temporarily. It's the new beginning that "version 1.0" means as well.
