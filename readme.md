This is one of my experimental homework when I was a sophomore. It has been a long time that I didn't maintain it. Besides, It's the first project that I pushed on the Github! As an old saying goes, "Practice makes perfect". I think if I wanna be a senior programmer. I must practice more. I define this commit as version 1.0 temporarily. It's the new beginning that "version 1.0" means as well.

Let me tell you some basic information! This project is based on Java(JDBC). The core function is generated by JDBC which is the interface that support Java to execute SQL. And I commited the bak file to the Github in project directory which contains a folder named db where within it.
